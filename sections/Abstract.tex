Tremendous efforts are performed worldwide to develop better forecasts which include, 
among other topics, meteorology and air quality. Mexico City is a mega-city that have 
recurrent episodes of high pollution levels. Governmental strategies to mitigate these 
events needs better forecasts of the air quality, among other information. Here, an 
operational air quality forecast, based on machine learning that considers 15-year of hourly air quality 
measurements and a numerical meteorological forecast, is implemented and evaluated. 
The operational system is available at \url{http://pronosticos.unam.mx/contaminantes/}.
