    abstract = { AbstractAir quality forecasts produced by the National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC), human air quality forecasters, and persistence are evaluated for predictive skill and economic value when used to inform decisions regarding pollutant emission and exposure. Surface ozone forecasts and observations were collected from 40 monitors representing eight forecast regions throughout Washington, D.C.; Virginia; and Maryland over the 2005–09 ozone seasons (April–October). The skill of the forecasts are quantified using discrete statistics, such as correlation, mean bias, and root-mean-square error, and categorical statistics, such as exceedance hit rate, false alarm rate, and critical success index. The value of the forecasts are quantified using a decision model based on costs to protect the public against a poor air quality event and the losses incurred if no protective measures are taken. The results indicate that the most skillful forecast method is not necessarily the most valuable forecast method. Air shed managers need to consider multiple forecast methods when deciding on multiple protective measures, because a single measure of forecast skill can often hide the user’s sensitivity to forecast error for a specific decision. }

MET is a set of verification tools developed by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the numerical weather prediction community -- and especially users and developers of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model -- to help them assess and evaluate the performance of numerical weather predictions.

It is important to note here that MET is an evolving software package. Previous releases of MET (METv1.0 and METv2.0) occurred in 2008 and 2009, respectively. This documentation describes the 3.0 release from fall of 2010 that includes new capabilities and enhancements as well as corrections to some errors or system issues. Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. In the future, MET will also be able to accept new modules contributed by the community. A protocol will be established to determine the maturity of new verification methods that are contributed and to coordinate the inclusion of new modules in future versions.

This user's guide was prepared by the developers of the MET, including John Halley Gotway, Randy Bullock, Paul Oldenburg, Tara Jensen, Lacey Holland, Barbara Brown, Tressa Fowler, David Ahijevych, and Eric Gilleland},

    abstract = {Abstract A general framework for forecast verification based on the joint distribution of forecasts and observations is described. For further elaboration of the framework, two factorizations of the joint distribution are investigated: 1) the calibration-refinement factorization, which involves the conditional distributions of observations given forecasts and the marginal distribution of forecasts, and 2) the likelihood-base factorization, which involve the conditional distributions of forecasts given observations and the marginal distribution of observations. The names given to the factorizations reflect the fact that they relate to different attributes of the forecasts and/or observations. Several examples are used to illustrate the interpretation of these factorizations in the context of verification and to describe the relationship between the respective factorizations. Some insight into the potential utility of the framework is provided by demonstrating that basic elements and summary measures of the joint, conditional, and marginal distributions play key roles in current verification methods. The need for further investigation of the implications of this framework for verification theory and practice is emphasized, and some possible directions for future research in this area are identified. }

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difﬁcult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than {VGG} nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classiﬁcation task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.},
